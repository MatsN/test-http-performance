# test-http-performance
Node.js mocha friendly http performance scenario test API

## Code Example

```javascript


```
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

test-http-performance was created because there were no modules for node that could be easily configured to do more advanced combinations of requests.
The idea is to provide a tool that can setup multiple simulated clients to run secarios consisting of a combination of request that will simulate intended use during a performance test.
The test will result in some test data being gathered, the data can then be tested against a set of requirements.
